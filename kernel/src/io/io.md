# in and out

In x86 assembly language, the IN and OUT instructions are used for input and output operations with I/O ports. These instructions facilitate communication between the CPU and peripheral devices, such as keyboards, printers, and other hardware components.

## IN Instruction

The IN instruction reads data from an I/O port into a CPU register. The general syntax is:

        IN destination, port

- destination: The register where the input data will be stored (usually AL, AX, or EAX depending on the size of the data).
- port: The address of the I/O port from which the data will be read. This can be specified as an immediate value or via the DX register.

        IN AL, 0x60   ; Read a byte from I/O port 0x60 into AL
        IN AX, DX     ; Read a word from the I/O port specified by DX into AX
        IN EAX, DX    ; Read a double word from the I/O port specified by DX into EAX

## OUT Instruction

The OUT instruction writes data from a CPU register to an I/O port. The general syntax is:

        OUT port, source

- port: The address of the I/O port to which the data will be written. This can be specified as an immediate value or via the DX register.
- source: The register that contains the data to be written (usually AL, AX, or EAX depending on the size of the data).

        OUT 0x60, AL  ; Write a byte from AL to I/O port 0x60
        OUT DX, AX    ; Write a word from AX to the I/O port specified by DX
        OUT DX, EAX   ; Write a double word from EAX to the I/O port specified by DX

## Practical Use Cases

    Keyboard Input: Reading key presses from the keyboard controller's data port.
    Screen Output: Sending data to a display controller to update the screen.
    Printer Communication: Sending commands or data to a printer's control port.
    Peripheral Initialization: Configuring hardware devices by writing specific values to their control ports during system startup.

These instructions are essential for low-level hardware programming and are typically used in operating system kernels, device drivers, and embedded systems where direct hardware control is required.


In x86 assembly language, the IN and OUT instructions come in several variations, depending on the size of the data being transferred and the method of specifying the I/O port. Here is a list of the different forms of IN and OUT instructions:

## IN Instructions

        Byte Input:
            IN AL, imm8 - Read a byte from the I/O port specified by an immediate 8-bit value into the AL register.
            IN AL, DX - Read a byte from the I/O port specified by the DX register into the AL register.

        Word Input:
            IN AX, imm8 - Read a word (16 bits) from the I/O port specified by an immediate 8-bit value into the AX register.
            IN AX, DX - Read a word (16 bits) from the I/O port specified by the DX register into the AX register.

        Double Word Input:
            IN EAX, imm8 - Read a double word (32 bits) from the I/O port specified by an immediate 8-bit value into the EAX register.
            IN EAX, DX - Read a double word (32 bits) from the I/O port specified by the DX register into the EAX register.

## OUT Instructions

        Byte Output:
            OUT imm8, AL - Write a byte from the AL register to the I/O port specified by an immediate 8-bit value.
            OUT DX, AL - Write a byte from the AL register to the I/O port specified by the DX register.

        Word Output:
            OUT imm8, AX - Write a word (16 bits) from the AX register to the I/O port specified by an immediate 8-bit value.
            OUT DX, AX - Write a word (16 bits) from the AX register to the I/O port specified by the DX register.

        Double Word Output:
            OUT imm8, EAX - Write a double word (32 bits) from the EAX register to the I/O port specified by an immediate 8-bit value.
            OUT DX, EAX - Write a double word (32 bits) from the EAX register to the I/O port specified by the DX register.

## Summary

There are a total of 12 variations of the IN and OUT instructions, 6 for each instruction, covering all combinations of byte, word, and double word transfers and both immediate and register-based port addressing.
